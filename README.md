Loan Approval System Using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning-based loan approval system designed to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on various factors such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant features.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The system handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical data.
Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented to predict loan approval, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Model Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Results
The system predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on the input features. The best-performing model was XGboost with an accuracy of 88%.
