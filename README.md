# **Loan Approval System Using Machine Learning**


## **Overview:**


This repository contains a machine learning-based loan approval system designed to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on various factors such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant features.


## **Features:**

Data Preprocessing: The system handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical data.

Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented to predict loan approval, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

Model Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## **Dataset:**

The dataset used for training the model includes features such as:

Applicant Income

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit History

Gender

Marital Status

Property Area


## **Results:**

The system predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on the input features. The best-performing model was XGboost with an accuracy of 88%.
